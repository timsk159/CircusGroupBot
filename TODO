Error handling

Error handling

main.py currently does too much fiddling with messages. Can let event and event_template objects manage this

Move a bunch of the functions in event_template.py and event.py into the respective classes
The way db is accessed is copy-pasted, need some helper functions

Need some way to clear the DB, as old events stay around forever

update_signups function gets given the entire bot object, which is overkill
